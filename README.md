# License-Key-Generator

This is an really simple License Key Generator. With the generate method you can generate keys and with the verify method you can check if the license is valid. You could extend the project by calculating the ASCII HEX code and maybe I will include it soon. But at any time remember that every security check that is done by the client is crackable. Unfortunately, if you really want to protect your code, you'll have to do all the security stuff through a server.
